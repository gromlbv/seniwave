        <h2 class="mono">What is SENIWAVE?</h2>

        <h3 class="mono">
            SENIWAVE exists to make launching digital products simple, creative, and honest.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mono">
            The name comes from “seni” (“contemporary art” in Indonesian) and “wave,” the energy of digital innovation.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mono">
            But the real story starts with our founder’s own experience: working as a product manager, navigating the maze of branding, web development, and setup—often piecing things together with freelancers who could only do part of the job, or agencies selling generic, overpriced packages tied to monthly fees.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mono">
            We saw how first-time founders and business owners end up overwhelmed—forced to learn new skills, overpay for partial solutions, or settle for websites that can’t really grow with them.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mono">
            We believed there was a better way.

        <h2 class="mono">How We Work</h2>
        <h3 class="mono">
            SENIWAVE brings together talented creators—designers, AI experts, developers, 3D and AR specialists—who focus on what they do best.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="mono">
            Every project is personally led by our founder, ensuring each case gets the care, expertise, and attention it deserves to achieve the best possible result.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="mono">
            We guide founders from raw idea to launch-ready product, without lock-in or unnecessary costs.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="mono">
            Our approach is quality over quantity: we take on a limited number of projects to maintain our high standards and deliver real results.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="mono">
            Our process is built for people who want their digital brand or product to truly work, without the usual headaches.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="mono">
            With a base in Dubai and a network across Europe and Russia, we offer a clear, efficient, and collaborative path from concept to launch.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="mono">
            Our white and purple palette reflects our belief in clarity, optimism, and the real value technology brings.
